<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
<p>My professional portfolio website will be one page and consist of the following items.</p>

<h2>Welcome</h2><p>I will have one background image with a stack of photos layered across the top of my page. These images will encompass who I am as a person sharing my professional goals and personal life. It will also state my name and position desired</p>
<h2>About Me</h2> <p>The about me section will list my professional work history, college degree, and newly acquired skillset I was exposed to and have become proficient in during the 10-week full-stack boot camp.</p>
<h2>Portfolio</h2> <p>I will create a 4-6 expanded card image gallery of items that, upon clicking, will expand with a quick synopsis of what the project was, what and how much I contributed, and things I would've done differently and if possible a link to the website. I want to showcase my ability to meet the client's needs, as well as express my ability to come up with fresh and new ideas. </p>
<h2>Contact</h2> <p>A simple web form with textboxes for their name, phone number, email, and message that will be emailed to me when someone enters their information. I will also provide a link using icons to my GitHub repository and LinkedIn profile in the nav or footer of my page.</p>

<h2>Wireframes</h2> <p>My webpage will be formatted in a z-format and be responsive for mobile view. I will create my wireframe on Balsamiq.com.</p>
