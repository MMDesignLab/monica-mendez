    <p>
    <p>Matthew has been working for Tech Recruiters as a WebDev and Devops recruiter for 10 years. He specializes in finding the right candidate for the job. Having worked in the IT field in the past gives him the advantage of being able to match skill set with job role responsibilities. He works hard to keep his clients happy because he realizes that there are plenty of different avenues to find talent nowadays. </p>
<h2 class="name2">Technology:</h2><p>He routinely uses Job Boards/Sites, LinkedIn, Social Media, Instagram and Referrals to find new talent.</p>
<h2 class="name2">Devices:</h2><p>Dell Laptop, HP Desktop and Android Phone.</p>

    <h2 class="name2">Attitudes and Needs:</h2><p>Matthew found my website using my LinkedIn profile after hearing of me through Esteban Martinez, our career recruiter. He likes my work history and skill set. He has viewed other sites like mine, but thinks my layout really showcases my knowledge of front and backend web development.</p>
   <h2>Frustrations:</h2><p>Matthew is currently frustrated because he is constantly filling the same role for a client. It seems he cannot get a long-term person to fill this position. His client has discussed the possibility of having to use another recruiting agency.</p>
