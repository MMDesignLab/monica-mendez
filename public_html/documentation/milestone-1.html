    <p><strong>Attitudes and Needs:</strong><br>Why are they using your site? Gmail is her email application for work.<br>What need does this persona have that your application aims to fill? She needs to be able to email co-workers and vendors throughout the workweek to stay updated on projects and timelines.<br>Why choose your site over other options? The company uses Gmail, Isadora prefers outlook.</p>
    <p><strong>Frustrations:</strong> <br>Isadora is a first time user of Gmail and is finding it difficult to keep emails organized because Gmail doesn't provide folders and their search capability is limited. She tried using<br>their labels to organize the emails, but when searching cannot seem to get all the emails she added the label back. She is feeling disorganized and like she is missing key details because she cannot gather<br>the information timely.
